        "  - It provides access to database metadata, including information about tables, columns, data types, access privileges, and other database objects. It's a standard feature in SQL databases for introspection and administration.\n",
        "  - Think of this as the database's administrative office. It doesn't hold our actual business data, but it keeps records about all the tables, columns, users, and privileges in the entire database system. It tells us what databases exist, what tables are in them, and who can access what.\n",
        "\n",
        "* `performance_schema`: This is designed for monitoring database performance.\n",
        "  - It provides a way to examine internal execution details of the server at a low level. It collects statistics on server events (like SQL statements, I/O, locks) and resource consumption, which is invaluable for performance tuning and troubleshooting.\n",
        "  - Imagine this as the database's diagnostic center. It collects data about how the database is performing – for example, how long queries are taking, what resources are being used, and if there are any bottlenecks. This helps engineers identify and fix performance issues.\n",

The `TABLE_ROWS` column indicates the number of rows in each table, and by filtering for `TABLE_ROWS > 0`, we ensure that we are looking at tables that actually contain data. This helps in identifying potentially important tables for further analysis. So far there are 206 non - empty tables in the `pathways_moodle` DataTable. Now let me extract the names of these tables, so we can dig deeper."

        "\n",
        "## Explanation:\n",
        "* **What we did**: We previously identified that the `pathways_moodle` database contains a total of 511 tables. Some of these tables were empty, meaning they didn't contain any useful information. In the last step, we filtered out all the empty tables and extracted a list of only those tables that actually contain data.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **What this means**:\n",
        "  - **Technical**: We have retrieved the `TABLE_NAME` column from the `df_non_empty_pathways_moodle` DataFrame, which was previously filtered to include only tables where `TABLE_ROWS > 0`. This result is a Python list of 206 strings, where each string is the name of a table within the `pathways_moodle` schema that contains at least one row of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Non-Technical**: Think of the database as a huge library with many books (tables). Some books are completely empty. What we've done is create a precise list of only the books that have actual content in them. This list contains 206 \"content-filled\" books that are important for Seefar Academy. These are the main sources of information about users, courses, and activities.\n",
        "\n",
        "This list is crucial as it guides the subsequent data extraction process, ensuring we only query and process tables that hold meaningful information, optimizing resources and focusing on relevant data assets."

        "4. **Document Schema**: Extract and document the schema (column names and data types) for each table successfully uploaded to Google Sheets. Present this documentation in a clear, readable format.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Analyze and Recommend Reporting Systems**: Based on the project objectives related to 'knowledge increase indicators' and differentiating data trends between 'employers, visa facilitators, and two different candidate groups', research and provide recommendations for suitable automated reporting systems.\n",
